<p><em>Note: A version of this article appears at <a href="http://rayhightower.com">RayHightower.com</a>.</em></p>

<p>How does one make the <a href="http://rayhightower.com/blog/2014/07/07/parallella-quick-start-guide-with-gotchas/">Parallella</a> run on solar energy? And why should anyone care to do so?</p>

<p>The fastest computers in the world gulp electricity at an alarming rate. For example, <a href="http://www.top500.org/system/177999">Tianhe-2</a> at the National Super Computer Center in Guangzhou, China uses 17.8 megawatts of energy per year. In dollars, that’s roughly $17 million spent on electricity spent each year, depending on how the electricity is sourced.</p>

<p>Scientists at <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/">Sandia National Laboratories</a> estimate that the earth&rsquo;s surface absorbs enough solar energy in ninety minutes to power every electrical device on the planet for a full year. A year&rsquo;s worth of energy in ninety minutes! Surely we can use some of that energy to power our supercomputers.</p>

<h3>Observations</h3>

<p>The solar Parallella idea was driven by a few observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Parallella only needs five watts of power, five volts at 1 ampere. The device might spike at startup or during heavy calculations, but not by much.</p></li>
<li><p>USB provides electrical power at five volts, typically less than 2 amperes.</p></li>
<li><p>Cell phone solar chargers are easy to find. These pocket-sized chargers provide power over USB.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Can a cell phone solar charger be hacked to power Parallella? Yes!</p>

<h3>Building the Hybrid Cable</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to get started&hellip;</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://rocksolar.com/images/parallella_usb_solar.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Making the connections.' title='Making the connections.'><span class='caption-text'>Making the connections.</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, get an off-the-shelf solar device capable of providing 5 volts at 2 amperes. Many cell phone solar chargers will do this, but some will only provide 1 ampere of current. You will need 2 amperes. As of this writing, Amazon sells solar cell phone chargers for about $35.00. Note that the model shown in this article combines a photovoltaic panel with a lithium ion battery. Energy provided by the sun can be stored by the battery for later use.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut open a USB cable to expose power (red), ground (black), and signal cables (green and white) as shown in the photo.</p></li>
<li><p>Find an old AC adapter cable that fits the Parallella power connection. Cut it open to expose the power and ground wires as shown in the photo.</p></li>
<li><p>Solder the USB power to the old adapter power wire, and USB ground to the adapter&rsquo;s ground.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover everything with heat shrink tubing or electrical tape. Heat shrink is preferred since it will last longer.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You&rsquo;re done! Plug everything in and watch your Parallella boot up. Note that this configuration will also power the Parallella&rsquo;s cooling fan.</p>

<h3>Proof of Concept</h3>

<p>It probably doesn’t make sense to call this a project. It&rsquo;s more of a proof of concept. Scaling up will cost money and time. But the benefits of solar energy, including cost savings and reduced carbon footprint, make this a worthwhile path to pursue.</p>
